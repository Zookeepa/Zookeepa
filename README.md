- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zookeepa
- 👀 I’m interested in scripting and automation of administrative tasks. In a corporate setting and small business setting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on better understanding and use of API calls, automation (I know nothing), automation of traditional networking tasks and side gigs.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Let me think on this one; here would be a perfect answer.
